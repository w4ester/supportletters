Subject: Quick Tool for Maryland IRC Support Letters

Hi [Contact],

To make it very easy for you to write a letter of support for Maryland's IRC program, we've created a simple online tool:

Please:
1. Select the credential(s) you want to support
2. Fill in your company info
3. Upload your logo (for template to have your letterhead just right)
4. Click Generate â†’ Email

The letter will be pre-filled and ready to send to MSDE!

Thank you for supporting Maryland CTE students!
