**Subject:** Quick & Easy: Support Maryland CTE Students (3 minutes)

Hi [First Name],

You previously expressed interest in supporting Maryland's Career & Technical Education programs. I have **great news** - we've made it incredibly easy for you!

We created a simple online tool that generates professional letters of support in just 3-5 minutes:

**🔗 https://[github-link]**

**How it works:**
1. Select the certification(s) your company values when hiring
2. Upload your logo (optional)
3. Fill in your contact info
4. Click generate → Click email → Done!

The letter will be professionally formatted on your letterhead and emailed directly to MSDE. 

**Why this matters:** Your support helps Maryland high school students earn industry-recognized credentials that prepare them for careers at companies like yours.

**Need:** We need 2 letters per credential from different businesses. One letter can support multiple certifications if relevant to your industry.

Can you take 3 minutes this week to help Maryland students?

Thank you for investing in Maryland's future workforce!

## 🤝 Coordination Strategy:

**I've created a tracking sheet** (will share via Teams) where we can mark:
- ✅ Who we've contacted
- ✅ Which credentials they're covering
- ✅ Letters received
- ⏳ Follow-up needed

**Please coordinate before reaching out** so we don't duplicate efforts! Check the sheet first, then mark your name next to who you're contacting.

## 💡 Tips for Success:

**When calling follow-ups, emphasize:**
- "It takes 3 minutes - we made it really simple"
- "You can support multiple certifications in one letter"
- "Your logo and info auto-populate on letterhead"
- "One click sends it directly to MSDE"

**For hesitant businesses:**
- Offer to walk them through it on a screen share
- Mention their competitors/peers who've already submitted
- Emphasize the small time investment for big impact on students

## 🎯 Our Goal:

**2 letters per IRC = 38 letters total** (19 credentials × 2)

With 152 businesses on the list and this easy tool, this is **absolutely achievable**!

## 📞 Questions?

Please reach out if you:
- Want help crafting outreach messages
- Need specific industry contacts
- Have suggestions to improve the tool
- Want to coordinate on specific credentials

Let's make this happen! We finally have a tool that removes the biggest barrier - **time and effort** - from businesses who want to help.

Thank you all for your hard work on this critical initiative! 💪

Best,
[Your Name]

**P.S.** The tool works on phones too, so businesses can literally generate and send letters during their lunch break!
